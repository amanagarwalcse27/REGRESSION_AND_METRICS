ðŸ“˜ Classification Metrics â€“ Test Format Notes

1. What is Accuracy?
   - Definition: Total correct predictions / Total predictions
   - Formula: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
   - Use Case: Jab classes balanced ho.

2. What is Precision?
   - Definition: Out of predicted positives, how many were actually positive.
   - Formula: TP / (TP + FP)
   - Use Case: Jab false positives avoid karne ho (e.g. spam detection).

3. What is Recall?
   - Definition: Out of actual positives, how many were correctly predicted.
   - Formula: TP / (TP + FN)
   - Use Case: Jab false negatives avoid karne ho (e.g. disease detection).

4. What is F1 Score?
   - Definition: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
   - Formula: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
   - Use Case: Jab Precision aur Recall dono important ho.

5. What is Confusion Matrix?
   - Definition: Table showing TP, TN, FP, FN.
   - Structure:
     |               | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
     |---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
     | Actual Positive | TP                | FN                 |
     | Actual Negative | FP                | TN                 |

6. Define the following:
   - TP (True Positive): Model ne correctly positive predict kiya.
   - TN (True Negative): Model ne correctly negative predict kiya.
   - FP (False Positive): Model ne galti se positive predict kiya.
   - FN (False Negative): Model ne galti se negative predict kiya.

7. Why is Accuracy not always reliable?
   - Reason: Agar data imbalanced ho (e.g. 95% healthy, 5% sick), toh accuracy misleading ho sakti hai.

8. Which metric is best for medical diagnosis?
   - Answer: Recall (kyunki false negative avoid karna important hai).

9. Which metric is best for spam detection?
   - Answer: Precision (kyunki false positive avoid karna important hai).

10. What is the ideal F1 Score?
    - Range: 0 to 1
    - Ideal: Closer to 1 means better balance between Precision and Recall.
